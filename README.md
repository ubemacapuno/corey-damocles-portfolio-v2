## Corey Damocles Portfolio: [Visit My Portfolio Here](https://coreydamocles.vercel.app/)

This is my second version of my portfolio with my recent projects and contact information, developed using SvelteKit.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**

Svelte/SvelteKit, GitHub API

## Install Locally

Using pnpm:

Install dependencies

```
$ pnpm i
```

Start development server

```
$ pnpm run dev
```

## Things to Add:

Create a `.env` file at the root directory and enter your GitHub API key:

```
VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=[ENTER GITHUB KEY HERE]
```

## Lessons Learned:

- Better understanding of SvelteKit and using an API to grab data server-side
- Better understanding of auto-importing components
- Better understanding of using a class-based CSS design system, and using POSTCSS
